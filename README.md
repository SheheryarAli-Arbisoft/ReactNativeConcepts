# React Native Concepts

This repository has been created to maintain a record of all the different Core Component API's in React Native. Each Component API has its own branch and contains a sample project which demonstrates its usage.

## Current branch: Layout API

The default layout used in a React Native application is Flexbox. Any layout is acheived by a combination of flexDirection, alignItems and justifyContent. Along with this other properties of flexbox can also be used such as flexGrow, flexShrink etc. to design a layout according to requirements. The default flexDirection is column.
