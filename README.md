# React Native Concepts

This repository has been created to maintain a record of all the different Core Component API's in React Native. Each Component API has its own branch and contains a sample project which demonstrates its usage.

## Current branch: Styled Components

The Styled Components for React can also be used in React Native with the difference that instead of HTML DOM elements we have to use the Core Component API's provided by React Native.
