# React Native Concepts

This repository has been created to maintain a record of all the different Core Component API's in React Native. Each Component API has its own branch and contains a sample project which demonstrates its usage.

## Current branch: Image and Dimensions API

### Image

This API is used whenever we want to render and image in the UI. It produces a native image view component.

### Dimensions

This API provides a mechanism by which we can get dimensions of the current screen. This is useful when we are developing an application in which responsiveness is required.
