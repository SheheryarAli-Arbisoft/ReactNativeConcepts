# React Native Concepts

This repository has been created to maintain a record of all the different Core Component API's in React Native. Each Component API has its own branch and contains a sample project which demonstrates its usage.

## Current branch: FlatList API

This API is used when we want to render a large list of items. Unlike a ScrollView this component renders only the items that can fit in the current viewport and only renders two or three items above and below the current view port. Because of this performance is increased on all devices as only the current set of items are rendered and not the entire list at once.
