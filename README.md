# React Native Concepts

This repository has been created to maintain a record of all the different Core Component API's in React Native. Each Component API has its own branch and contains a sample project which demonstrates its usage.

## Current branch: TouchableOpacity API

This API is used whenever we want to render a custom UI button instead of a default native button. This helps when trying to match the style of UI across Android and IOS. This component has all the props of Button and includes an additional style prop.
