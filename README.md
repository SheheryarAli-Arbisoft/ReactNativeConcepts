# React Native Concepts

This repository has been created to maintain a record of all the different Core Component API's in React Native. Each Component API has its own branch and contains a sample project which demonstrates its usage.

## Current branch: Async Storage

Async storage in an unecrypted key value based storage system which is used to persist data in React Native. The only limitation is that only string values can be persisted using this method. In case of objects they will have to be serialized first.
