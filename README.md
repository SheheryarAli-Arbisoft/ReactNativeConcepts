# React Native Concepts

This repository has been created to maintain a record of all the different Core Component API's in React Native. Each Component API has its own branch and contains a sample project which demonstrates its usage.

## Current branch: SectionList API

This API works in a similar manner as FlatList but with the added functionality of headings for different sections in a list.
