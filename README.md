# React Native Concepts

This repository has been created to maintain a record of all the different Core Component API's in React Native. Each Component API has its own branch and contains a sample project which demonstrates its usage.

## Current branch: Basics

This branch contains examples of the basic components which are used throughout a React Native app. These are mentioned below.

### 1. View

This API renders a native View component. All the components must be wrapped in parent view component for them to render.

### 2. Text

This API renders a native Text component. Any text used in the application must be used inside a Text component otherwise it will not render.

### 3. Button

This API render a native Button component. This is the simple button for that native environment. To use a custom button a TouchableOpacity can be used with additional styling.

### 4. Stylesheet

To customise any component a style prop must be provided. To maintain styles used in different components a style sheet can be created to wraps all the styles in a single object.
