# React Native Concepts

This repository has been created to maintain a record of all the different Core Component API's in React Native. Each Component API has its own branch and contains a sample project which demonstrates its usage.

## Current branch: SafeAreaView API

This component works only on IOS devices. This component is aware of the notch on later models of iPhones and also what are the boundaries of the view. On Android this view is the same as simple View component
